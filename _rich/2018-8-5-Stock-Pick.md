title: Stock picks for 2018
---

Hey these are my current stock picks on Questrade for the year of 2018.

It has been 1 month since I started investing now I have yet to see any fucking returns but that's fine...
Below is the split of 10k that intend to split within the bottom stocks, along with p/e ratio and dividend yield.

CANADA (5000) (40%)
  
  OWNED
  1. BCE.TO (Bell Canada) - 17 5.58% (probably to be removed the following year)
  2. ACB.TO (Aurora Canabis Inc) - ? ?
  
  UNOWNED
  3. WEED.TO (Canopy growth ltd.) - ? ?
  4. EMA.TO - 44.57 5.36%
  5. ENB.TO - 33.1 5.81%

ETF'S (5000) (40%)
  6. ZAG.TO 20% (1000) - ? 2.97%
  7. VCN.TO 27% (1350) - ? 2.35%
  8. XAW.TO 53% (2650) - ? 1.99%

Index fund for S&P 500 (2,500) (20%)
  9. SPY (20%) - ? 1.75%
  
Explanation: I'm buying only Canadian stock at the moment due to lack of background with Norbit's gambit or any information about international markets. I'm buying marujiana stocks because of the positive trend dispensaries are having in the U.S.A as well as the expected market they are bringing. I bought Bell canada, and intend to buy energy companies, because I thought of the things I actually use and apart from my laptop I use the internet and electricity, those two things are never going away. Finally I took a random questionnaire to find the etf's and I picked spy because it was the best way to track the S&P 500.
