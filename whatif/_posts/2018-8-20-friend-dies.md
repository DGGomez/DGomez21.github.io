Note:

My neighbour passed away. Not today, they have no idea when he passed. He died sometime between now and three weeks ago.
He was a kind man, I remember when I first met him and he gave me a popsicle. It might not seem like much but up until that point that was 
the nicest thing anyone had done for me. He never wanted anything, he only helped and talked about soccer. He was a bus driver
for many years and then spent his life helping all his neighbours. I guess he couldn't help but liking people.

I'm upset he died, I'm more upset that he died alone. One of the few fears I have is dying alone, something too real about the possibility.
I suppose that's why people get married in such high numbers. I just wish he didn't have to be alone in his final moments, I just wish
I could've been there just so he didn't have to scared in his last moments. He was a good man. He deserved more.

Goodbye Bill, you were a great friend and neighbour. I love you man.
