All of this year and next year I'm remaking all my old projects into actually working projects. Starting with my idea of lifter
which is an app that allows you to find a gym partner that goes to your gym anyway. OPriginally made in react-native but now
I'm trying it first with react and mongo then moving over to react-native so I can have a web app and a mobile app.

BYE!!!
