title: Plans for this blog
---

So I've been thinking about what to put on here and I've decided to create several subsections to this blog. 

I plan to have a section for stocks, if I'm writing, what books I'm reading, what projects I'm working on, and just random thoughts. I 
also plan to change the template and colour scheme. Also I doubt anyone is reading this so I guess this is more like an online journal
then anything else.

Bye
