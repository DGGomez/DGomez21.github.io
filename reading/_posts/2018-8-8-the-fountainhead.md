title: The Fountainhead
---

So I've been reading this book called the Fountainhead by Ayan Rand. It started off as a one dude sticking to his dreams with no compromise. If he didn't want to do something he didn't do it. Then there was his exact opposite this dude who didn't like what he was doing but he succeeded, everything he did was compromise. 

So basically no ones fucking happy in this book and the logic behind it all is kinda bat shit. So there's this criticing guy who basically knows the main character is the shit but writes shit reviews just to prove that people are dumb as fuck and listen to whatever he says. Then the chick who falls in love with the main character says she is so into the main character that she can't be with him to punish herself. The dumbest fucking shit.

I haven't finished the book yet so maybe it changes but for now, the logic in the books is weird at best.
