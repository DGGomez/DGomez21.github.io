# Candito training #

So currently I'm doing the powerlifting style training made by Candito Training.

[Programs](http://www.canditotraininghq.com/free-programs/)

The link above shows all the programs offered and I'm doing the Candito 6 Week Strength Program. I really like it
and I've seen some postive results in the present and in the past.
